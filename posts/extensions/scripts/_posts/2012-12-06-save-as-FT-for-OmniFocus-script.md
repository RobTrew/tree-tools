An applescript which offers a Save As dialog, and saves the current OmniFocus selection in FoldingText format.

- The whole ancestral path of the selected OmniFocus material is saved.
- OmniFocus projects become FoldingText .todo lines.
- OmniFocus folders become nested parents of the project line.
- OmniFocus dates, flags, and duration fields become @key(value) tags in FoldingText.
